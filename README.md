# EmbeddingPython
A POC showing how Python can be embedded in C/C++.

An Internet-based article on using multiple programming languages to develop an application aroused my interest and inspired me to try doing so using
C/C++ and Python.

C forms the backbone here and calls into Python to start a calculator program.

To compile on Ubuntu, pass the libpython library.
gcc <c-program> -lpython2.7 -o <executable>
